# OOP Game Show

This is an OOP JavaScript game that plays similar to Hangman. You guess the letters of a phrase using either the on-screen keyboard or your computer keyboard, and the display updates according to if the letter is in the phrase or not. You get a total of 5 lives to guess the phrase, so be aware!

## Extras

### Style Changes

**Font**: I decided to use a new Google Font (Jura) that has been imported at the top of styles.css.

**Transitions**: I added transitions to the display of correctly guessed phrase letters.

**Colors**: I changed the main colors around for the game board itself. I went with a tan background and dark blue/gray selections on top.
